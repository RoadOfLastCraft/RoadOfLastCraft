## It's only nickname
From what starts every person? From his name.
My name on github - RoadOfLastCraft, it means that world loses value, we are commited to lose us, some day we gonna do last 
thing, we won't even think about, and i am despairing.

 Why I used Craft, but not thing? Because I created this nickname for minecraft, but i think i should end with cubes
